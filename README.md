# Using Multi-Resolution Data to Accelerate Training for DeepCAM
This repository contains an improvement of [DeepCAM](https://github.com/azrael417/mlperf-deepcam) by adding the support of utlizing multi-resolution data.
DeepCAM is a parallel deep learning climate segmentation benchmark. The source codes of DeepCAM are available on both [github](	
https://github.com/azrael417/mlperf-deepcam) and [MLPerf](https://mlcommons.org/en/training-hpc-10/).
The [training data files](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=0b226e2c-4de0-11ea-971a-021304b0cca7&origin_path=%2F) are available at GLOBUS.
